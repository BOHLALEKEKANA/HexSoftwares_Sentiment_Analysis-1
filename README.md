# HexSoftwares_Sentiment_Analysis

The project will include loading text data, processing it, and outputting sentiment scores (positive, negative, or neutral). I'll assume you're analyzing a small dataset of customer reviews stored in a text file. The code will read the reviews, analyze sentiment, and display results.

How to Run the Project:

Install Dependencies:

Ensure Python 3.6+ is installed.
Install required libraries: pip install textblob pandas
Download TextBlob's corpora: python -m textblob.download_corpora

Run the Script:
Save the code to a file named sentiment_analysis.py.
Run it using python sentiment_analysis.py.

Expected Output:
The script creates a reviews.txt file with sample reviews.
It analyzes each review, categorizes sentiment (Positive, Negative, Neutral), and calculates polarity scores (-1 to 1).
Results are displayed in a table and saved to sentiment_results.csv.
A summary shows the total reviews, counts of each sentiment type, and average polarity.

Notes:

The script uses TextBlob for simplicity, which is good for basic sentiment analysis. For more advanced needs (e.g., deep learning), consider Hugging Faceâ€™s Transformers.
You can replace reviews.txt with your own dataset (one review per line).
The polarity score ranges from -1 (very negative) to 1 (very positive), with 0 being neutral.
